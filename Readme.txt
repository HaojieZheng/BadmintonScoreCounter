Badminton Score Counter 1.2

by Zheng Haojie

== Introduction ==
This is a simple project for me to get hands on with Android application programming.

The goal of this app is to make an app that serves 2 purposes. The first is for badminton umpires
to use during tournaments to keep track of scores. Sometimes it can be hard to both remember the
scores, where the players should stand (especially doubles) and to notice fouls in the game. This
app can help to reduce the mental strain by tracking the score and the player positions. The second
purpose is for badminton clubs to keep track of their games. They will be able to use the player
ranking feature to award the best player, or the player with the best turnout rate, or just as a
record to calculate membership fees.

The app is available on the app store at: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.haojie.badmintonscorecounter&hl=en
